# GA-signal-optimizer
This code is specified to find the optimal cycle time as well as green phase time of each link of an intersection. With a simple data set of traffic throughput, delay values, it uses pattern recognition and analyze performance, without dependency on objective function. 
For our project, we used PTV VISSIM microsimulation to run the model of the intersection and gather necessary input values.
The GA code then analyzed each of the parameters of the performance analysis obtained from the simulator and run the GA optimization.
The ultimate result is the phase time of 4 individual link and overall cycle time which the optimal.
